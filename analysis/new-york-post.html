            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                This article titled “Trump-Ukraine story is what you get when the media imagines the facts” was
                published September 25, 2019, to the New York Post Website. In the article the writers talk about the
                incident between the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky and President Trump that is known as
                “Ukraine-Gate.” The article specifically talks about the phone call transcript between the two presidents
                and the media’s reaction to it. In the article the writers claim that its been a complete overreaction by
                the media and that we shouldn’t be convicting President Trump, especially when we still don’t have all
                the information. They write in the article that the media is trying to paint a picture of an “out-of-control
                prez.” What they’re trying to say is that the general public shouldn’t overreact as well, we should wait
                till we have all the facts, and that some of the things Trump is being accused of were never said
                according to the Transcript.

                The New York Post citing all these publications articles is also an example of Logos
                because they use the logic that “If these four publications that we just linked in our article are
                overreacting to the news, then all of them are.” Another example of logos in the article is when
                they discredit the media by saying that they “relied on leaks and third- or fourth-party accounts
                — not even hearsay, but gossip.”

            </div>

            <p>
                Pathos is used
                throughout the article to appeal to readers emotionally, in the article they paint a picture of the
                media being the offender and the President Trump a victim. In the article they make sure to
                further this point by making it look like the media is calling President Trump an “out-of-control
                prez.”

            </div>
            <p>
                Throughout the article they make sure to cite multiple writing publications that have
                already prosecuted President Trump. Citing these publications is an example of ethos because the
                New York Post being able to back up they’re main claim of the media overreacting to the
                situation shows credibility.

        <div class="idea">
            <h2>Idea Critique</h2>
            <p>
                In this article published to the New York Post there are some takes that I do <span class="agree">agree</span> on but
                for the most part I mainly <span class="disagree">disagree</span> with the article. It is true that the media does like to overreact
                to situations surrounding the president and sometimes it does look like they’re trying to paint a
                “out-of-control” president. However what President Trump decided to ask the Ukrainian
                president to do is seemingly brushed off as something that isn’t a big deal. The president of the
                United States was trying to bribe a foreign leader with $400 million dollars in aid to target a
                presidential candidate. Then the writers of the article try to excuse his behavior by pointing out another inside in which Joe Biden also threatened Ukraine officials, like if him doing something
                bad cancels out whatever President Trump is tried to do.

        <div class="reflection">
            <h2>Personal Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                In the end all this scandal does is reinforce negative ideas to both U.S. citizens about our
                politicians and to the world about the state of U.S. politics and our corruptive politicians
                grabbing onto other countries. Already a lot of Americans don’t vote because they feel like there
                vote wont make a difference because everything is rigged, and when scandals like these are
                exposed it just reaffirms those beliefs for these people and in turn makes them less likely to
                participate in politics and the important duty that is voting. If the president of the United States is
                bribing other countries what stops people from thinking voting isn’t rigged or that other countries
                are willing to influence elections? How will a foreign countries population view the United
                States when they see headlines saying the president of the United States is trying to bribe their
                leaders?
