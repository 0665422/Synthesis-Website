            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                In “Volodymyr Zelensky, Man in the Muddle” published in The New York Times on October 8 2019, The Editorial Board explores the current political situation around Ukraine-Gate, specifically Donald Trump’s attempts to use President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine for his own political gains and make friends with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who threatens democratic stability in Ukraine. The Editorial Board notes recent telephone conversation between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky stating that it “does evoke embarrassment”, as Ukrainian President becomes a victim of Mr. Trump’s schemes (The New York Times).  The Board also points out that American President refers to Mr. Putin as “a soul mate”, while Russia blocks Ukraine’s will for becoming a democratic society, which European nations helped and will help build (The New York Times).  The editorial ends with the call to “avoid damaging Ukraine’s prospects” because of Mr. Trumps political ambitions (The New York Times).

            <h2>Rhetorical Critique</h2>
            <h3>Logos</h3>
            <div class="gauge">
                <img src="../assets/spedometer.svg" />
                <div class="needle"></div>
                <div class="gauge-center"></div>
            </div>
            <p>
                Editorial Board decided to limit the amount of logos in their article, leaving only important information that helps reader comprehend the background of the topic. In the introduction, Editorial Board wrote: “Ukrainian voters took a desperate gamble and elected as their president a television performer” (The New York Times). This information definitely helps to reveal some of the characters in the article, but it is not used for persuasive or rhetorical reasons, thus its effects on reader’s opinion is limited.

            <h3>Pathos</h3>
            <div class="gauge">
                <img src="../assets/spedometer.svg" />
                <div class="needle"></div>
                <div class="gauge-center"></div>
            </div>

            <p>
                Authors use a lot of pathos, such as “colliding with rude reality” and “Mr. Trump’s disdain for Ukraine”, to create a negative connotation of recent events and to support the argument that Trump should be impeached (The New York Times). Such phrases can have serious effect on a reader if used with high frequency in the text.

        <div class="ethos">
            <h3>Ethos</h3>
            <div class="gauge">
                <img src="../assets/spedometer.svg" />
                <div class="needle"></div>
                <div class="gauge-center"></div>
            </div>
            <p>
                Ethos are not explicitly stated in the article, but with my own research I was able to find that it can be considered somewhat credible. Carol Giacomo, the member of The Editorial Board responsible for Foreign Affairs, was a diplomatic correspondent for twenty decades before joining Editorial Board in 2007. She received multiple awards for her works, including the Arthur Ross Media award for foreign affairs commentary (2018) and the Georgetown University Weintal Prize for diplomatic reporting (2008). Of course, there are multiple members in The Editorial Board meaning there are a lot of possibilities for mixed opinions, so we can’t rely on the credibility of one person.

        <div class="idea">
            <h2>Idea Critique</h2>
            <p>
                I <span class="agree">agree</span> with the author about the global political situation around Ukraine today. The Editorial Board of The New York Times implies that Ukraine is the battleground of two world powers: Unites States of America and Russian Federation, specifically the interests and goals of their leaders Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin (The New York Times). This thesis is clearly reflected in recent political events, including Ukraine-Gate.<br /><br />
                At the same time, I <span class="disagree">disagree</span> with the editorial’s view about Ukraine’s role in 2016 U.S. president elections and Baidens’ actions in Ukraine. The Editorial Board suggests that Ukraine’s political leaders did not support Democrats in United States presidential election and that Baiden case is fabricated calling them “discredited far-right conspiracy theories” (The New York Times). I think it is inappropriate to write such radical phrases without providing any concrete evidences that disprove those theories. Especially, it is inappropriate for The New York Times magazine, one of the most popular magazines in United States, which has huge influence on public opinion.

        <div class="reflection">
            <h2>Personal Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                For me, this article triggers memories of my previous political views on my motherland, Ukraine, and the main events that happened in my country not too long ago. In fact, some of the topics raised in the text like, Putin’s goals to limit Ukraine’s western movement, have initiated my migration to United States. Back then I was only thirteen years old, so I didn’t have any strong political views or beliefs. The only thing I can remember is that some people in eastern Ukraine wanted succession from Ukraine to join Russian Federation, but others didn’t, so the war began.<br /><br />
                The editorial clearly states that Putin’s goal is to “block the rise of a democratic Ukraine” (The New York Times). This point really reinforces my personal beliefs that are based on the fact that Russia tries to return Ukraine into its satellite as it was in Soviet Union and not let it become one of the western countries, especially a member of NATO. I, as Ukrainian, strongly support the idea that my country should approach European values and society, entering a family of European nations. I admire The Editorial Board that they are on the Ukraine’s side in this conflict, helping Americans to know more about Ukraine’s struggles.
